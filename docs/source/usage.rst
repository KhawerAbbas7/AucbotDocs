Setting up prefix
------------------

The default prefix for Aucbot is ``auc!``. If you want to change it, you can do that by:

   auc!prefix .
.. NOTE:: In the case above new prefix will be ``.`` You can change it to anything.

A logging channel is a channel where auction logs are sent, such as who bought what and what was unsold. This is an essential step to start the auction.
